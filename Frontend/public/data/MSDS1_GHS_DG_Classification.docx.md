**3\) Dangerous Goods (DG) Classification (Class and Codes)**

Based on **Section 14 – Transport Information**, the DG classification differs by transport mode:

**U.S. DOT (49 CFR)**

* **UN Number**: **NA 1993**

* **Proper Shipping Name**: *Combustible liquid, n.o.s.*  
  (contains 2,6-dimethyloct-7-en-2-ol, 2,6-dimethyloctanol)

* **Hazard Class**: Combustible Liquid

* **Packing Group**: **III**

* **ERG Guide**: 128 

MSDS1

⚠️ **Regulatory Note (Critical):**

* **Not regulated as a DG in non-bulk packaging ≤119 gallons (450 L)** under 49 CFR 

MSDS1

**IMDG (Sea Transport)**

* **Not regulated as Dangerous Goods** 

MSDS1

**IATA (Air Transport)**

* **Not regulated as Dangerous Goods**

**4\) Rationale Summary – GHS & Dangerous Goods Determination**

**Why this material is GHS-classified**

The GHS classification is driven primarily by **health hazards** and **combustibility**, not extreme flammability:

* The **flash point of 89 °C** places the product in **Flammable Liquid Category 4**, qualifying it as a **combustible liquid** rather than a highly flammable one.

* Multiple constituents contribute to **skin irritation**, **eye irritation**, and **skin sensitization**, justifying **H315, H319, and H317**.

* Toxicological evaluation indicates **suspected reproductive toxicity (Category 2\)**, resulting in **H361**.

* These classifications are explicitly stated by the manufacturer in Section 2 and supported by component toxicology in Sections 3 and 11 

MSDS1

.

**Why it is (conditionally) a Dangerous Good**

* Under **U.S. DOT**, the material qualifies as **NA 1993, Combustible Liquid, PG III** **only when shipped in bulk quantities**.

* The flash point exceeds 60 °C, excluding it from Class 3 flammable liquids but still meeting the U.S. definition of a **combustible liquid**.

* International regulations (**IMDG, IATA**) do **not** classify this material as Dangerous Goods due to higher flash point thresholds and lower transport risk profiles.

**Regulatory Conclusion**

* **GHS**: Classified due to health and combustible hazards.

* **DG**:

  * **Regulated (U.S. DOT only)** → bulk shipments

  * **Not regulated** → non-bulk, air, or sea transport

This dual outcome is common for fragrance and specialty chemical mixtures with **moderate flash points but significant health hazards**.
