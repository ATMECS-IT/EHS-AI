**2\) GHS Classification (Class and Codes)**

**GHS / CLP Classification**

* **Not classified as hazardous** under Regulation (EC) No. 1272/2008 (CLP) 

MSDS2

**Hazard Classes**

* **None assigned**

**Hazard Statements**

* **EUH210** – Safety Data Sheet available on request

* **EUH212** – Warning\! Hazardous respirable dust may be formed when used. Do not breathe dust.

**Signal Word**

* **Not applicable**

**Pictograms**

* **None**

📌 These EUH statements are **supplemental information only** and **do not constitute a GHS hazard classification**.

**3\) Dangerous Goods (DG) Classification (Class and Codes)**

Based on **Section 14 – Transportation Information**, the product is **not regulated as Dangerous Goods** under any major transport regulations:

**DG Status**

* **UN Number**: Not regulated

* **Proper Shipping Name**: Not regulated

* **Hazard Class**: Not regulated

* **Packing Group**: Not regulated 

MSDS2

**Applicable Regulations**

* IMDG (Sea): Not regulated

* IATA (Air): Not regulated

* ADR/RID/ADN (Road/Rail/Inland Waterways): Not regulated

**4\) Rationale Summary – GHS & Dangerous Goods Determination**

**Why TX-85 is NOT GHS-classified**

* The SDS explicitly states **“Not Applicable”** for GHS/CLP classification.

* Although titanium dioxide is present at high concentration, the SDS clarifies that it **does not meet the respirable particle criteria** (≤10 μm at ≥1%), which is the trigger for TiO₂ carcinogenic classification under EU CLP.

* Toxicological data indicate:

  * No skin corrosion or serious eye damage

  * No sensitization

  * No acute toxicity classification thresholds met

* The EUH212 statement is precautionary and applies **only if dust is generated**, not under normal handling conditions

.

**Why TX-85 is NOT a Dangerous Good**

* The material is:

  * **Non-flammable**

  * **Non-reactive**

  * **Non-toxic for transport purposes**

  * **Solid powder with no DG hazard classes**

* No UN number, hazard class, or packing group is assigned under IMDG, IATA, ADR, RID, or ADN.

* Environmental hazard criteria are not met for DG transport

**Regulatory Conclusion**

| Aspect | Determination |
| :---- | :---- |
| GHS / CLP | **Not classified** (EUH statements only) |
| DG (All modes) | **Not Dangerous Goods** |
| Transport restrictions | None |
| Primary handling concern | Dust control (occupational exposure) |

TX-85 is therefore considered a **non-hazardous cosmetic raw material** under both **GHS** and **Dangerous Goods transport regulations**, with standard industrial hygiene controls recommended to minimize dust exposure.
