The flash point exceeds 60 °C, excluding it from Class 3 flammable liquids but still meeting the U.S. definition of a combustible liquid. International regulations (IMDG, IATA) do not classify this material as Dangerous Goods due to higher flash point thresholds and lower transport risk profiles.",
