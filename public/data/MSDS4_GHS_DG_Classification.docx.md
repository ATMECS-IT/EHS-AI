**GHS Rationale**

* The product causes **skin irritation** and **skin sensitization**, meeting the criteria for:

  * Skin Irritation Category 2 (H315)

  * Skin Sensitisation Category 1 (H317)

* No components trigger carcinogenicity, flammability, or systemic toxicity classifications at reportable levels.

* The **flash point of 119 °C** is well above the GHS flammable liquid thresholds, excluding flammability classification. 

MSDS4

**Dangerous Goods Rationale**

* The product contains fragrance ingredients (e.g., octahydro tetramethyl naphthalenyl ethanone) that meet **aquatic environmental hazard criteria**.

* Under **IATA and IMDG**, substances hazardous to the aquatic environment are classified as:

  * **UN 3082, Class 9, Packing Group III**

* Ground transport under DOT allows exemption; however, air and sea regulations **mandate DG classification**, making this product **conditionally regulated** depending on transport mode.
